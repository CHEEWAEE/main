# take-status: Displays submission details for a specific student (`zid`) in the `.take` system.
# Usage: take-status <zid>
# - Checks if the `.take/` directory exists.
# - Searches all assignments in `.take/` for submissions from the given `zid`.
# - If submissions exist, lists the number of submissions and their details.
# - If no submissions are found, prints "no submissions for <zid>".
# Exits with 1 on errors, 0 if no submissions exist.
